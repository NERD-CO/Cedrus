EMOTION TASKS:
%% Note that the task event codes are shared between all emotion studies,
%% but may mean slightly different things depending on the task (as noted).
%% Each different task has a unique identifier as the first TTL.
%% Task event codes:
TTL pulse marking task start = 19
TTL pulse marking word/image shown = 29
TTL pulse marking first fixation cross shown (read, speak, execute, n-back) OR multiple choices shown (name3, name7) = 39
TTL pulse marking speak/execute cue (read, speak, execute) OR response made (name3, name7, n-back) = 49
TTL pulse marking second fixation cross shown (speak, execute) = 59
TTL pulse marking audio recording start = 69
TTL pulse marking audio recording stop = 79
TTL pulse marking video recording start (first frame) = 89
TTL pulse marking the 1000th video frame = 99
%% Task identifier codes
"Read" Task = 191
"Speak" Task = 192
"Execute" Task = 193
"Name 3" Task = 194
"Name 7" Task = 195
"N-Back" Task = 196


Replaced all %DatapixxAOttl();
with:
write(device,sprintf("mh%c%c", 20, 0), "char");
where '20' changes based on TTL signature desired
NOTE: Cedrus code numbers must be < 256 (cedrus only sends an 8-bit number)
